# Flip Golf

This is a project using TypeScript and [https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser](Phaser) 3.

The game's goal is simple:

You have a set of 25 cards, each containing a value: 1, 2, or 3. Each card you flip multiplies your current score with whatever value it holds. So if you flip a 3, then a 3, then a 2, your score becomes 18. As such, there's a set maximum score worth all the 3s and 2s on the board that you not only need to reach, but you need to reach with the *fewest flips possible*. This game is inspired by Pokemon's [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_Flip](Voltorb Flip), hence the repository's description.

Steps left before completion:
* Create the HUD (at least something that can be showed and displayed).
* Playtest the game.
* Profit.
* Arsenal.
